## OSC Skeleton Viewer & Recorder

There are two approaches now, Supercollider (.sc) and Python (.py), the latter
being abandoned for the moment.

* osceleton.sc 
    * SuperCollider one
    * needs SuperCollider 3.6+.

* osceleton.py
    * needs PyOSC
    * uses 100% at the moment :/
    
* oscRecord 
    * contains a slightly patched version of the OSC record/playback program by [@LFSaw](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.supercollider.user/32629h)
    * Usage:
        * ./player.py recordings-20130126-slackline_gathering/chantal_1.db localhost 57120
